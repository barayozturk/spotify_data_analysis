# 🎵 Music Tracks Analysis 🎶

## Introduction 🎉

This repository contains code to analyze music tracks data using Python and popular data analysis libraries. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and data visualization techniques.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy 🧮
- pandas 🐼
- matplotlib 📊
- seaborn 🌊

### Installation 💻

Clone the repository:
  ````bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-tracks-analysis.git
  ````

Install the required libraries:

  ````bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
  ````

## Usage 🎛️

1. Place your music tracks data in a CSV file named `tracks.csv`.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `music_tracks_analysis.ipynb` to perform data analysis.

## Features 📈

- Read music tracks data from CSV.
- Explore data for null values and basic information.
- Preprocess data: convert date format, calculate duration, and drop unnecessary columns.
- Visualize data: create a correlation heatmap and other plots.

## Examples 📊

### Correlation Heatmap 🔥
